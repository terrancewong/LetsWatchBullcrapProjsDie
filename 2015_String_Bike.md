## Specifications

There's not much real specifications about the mechanism itself.

## The team

Underwater / underground.

## Violation of basic engineering knowledge

Listen to themselves, not me.

* "Clean & oil free"

Rubbing metal against metal without oil, good luck with that. And good luck to your other moving parts.

* "Smooth & graceful"

Also trim something by trapping them into the mechanism.

* "No noise"

As said above, rubbing metal against metal and no noise, good luck with that.

* "Drive it like a car"

Yeah, ride a bike like a car.


## Let's
