## The team

Most professional (who makes the thing fly) members

* 1 "Research Engineer" from NASA+Boeing+Airbus, **Luca Benassi**, but his field of research is not mentioned.
* 1 Car Designer, **Frank Stephenson**


## Violation of basic engineering knowledge
1. 36 tiny fans (or engines whatever they call it). Extremely low static thrust (hovering) efficiency.
2. Configuration of 36 tiny fans, 6x2 front, 12x2 rear.

## Let's 
see how and when this project dies.
