"Let's Watch Bullcrap Projects Die"

## Why

I'm tired of those bull&*$# "high tech world changing invention"s.

## How

1. Collect fancy "high tech projects", point out their bull#%&@.
1. Wait and watch them burn slowly.
1. Let's enjoy watching them die.
1. Hope you readers learn some real science and engineering.
